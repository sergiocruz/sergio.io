A practical guide to applying Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles when working with existing legacy systems, helping teams modernize complex codebases incrementally.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding legacy system challenges and constraints
- Identifying bounded contexts in existing codebases
- Strategies for gradual domain model extraction
- Anti-corruption layer patterns and implementation
- Event storming techniques for legacy systems
- Refactoring strategies that preserve business logic
- Building team consensus around domain modeling
- Balancing technical debt with feature development

This course provides hands-on techniques for engineering teams looking to apply modern DDD practices to existing systems without the luxury of greenfield development. Perfect for teams dealing with monolithic applications, unclear domain boundaries, or complex legacy architectures.
