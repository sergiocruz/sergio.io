That's why I'm excited to put all the information you need in a simple-to-follow article. Please note that this article assumes you're running an unix operating system.\n\n\nHere's an overview of the steps we're covering:\n\n1. Create a personal access token on GitHub\n1. Add an npm registry resolver to your local environment\n1. Add a file to the repository that will be consuming the private package\n1. Start consuming your packages\n\nBefore we can start consuming private packages, the registry needs to know who you are each time you try to access it. That's why we'll start by creating a personal access token on GitHub. Your system will use it each time it needs to access the GitHub Packages Registry to install libraries.\n\n## Create a personal access token on GitHub\n\nStart by creating a [personal token on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new):\n\n1. For the `Note` field, put down \"GitHub Packages\" as the description, so we'll know what we used this token for in the future\n1. Under `Select scopes`, select the `repo` option: _(checking the `repo` scope, should automatically check all the options under it:)_\n    * `repo:status`\n    * `repo_deployment`\n    * `public_repo`\n    * `repo:invite`\n    * `security_events`\n    * `read:packages`\n\n1. Hit the \"Generate Token\" button\n1. Copy the newly generated token onto your clipboard, as we're going to use it shortly\n\n\n\n## Add an npm registry resolver to your local environment\n\nWe're going to authenticate you into the GitHub Packages Registry by using your GitHub username and the Personal Access Token you just created as the password. To do so, pull up your Terminal and follow these steps:\n\n* Run `npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com` and enter these options:\n  * **Username**: Enter your GitHub username\n  * **Password**: Paste the Personal Access Token you previously created\n  * **Email**: Enter an email address associated with your GitHub account\n\nNow npm will know how to forward your authentication credentials to the GitHub Packages Registry every time we try to access it. That way GitHub Packages will know who you are and what packages you have access to.\n\n\n## Configure package consumption\n\nLet's create a new file at the root of your project called `.npmrc`. This file will instruct npm (or yarn) to pull packages directly from the GitHub Packages Registry. Below is an example of what your file should look like:\n\n```shell\n# File location: `~/some-directory/your-project/.npmrc`\n# Registry for the @my-org scope\n@my-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/\n```\n\nNow any libraries you add via `npm` or `yarn` that use the `@my-org` scope will be installed directly from the GitHub Packages Registry.\n\n### A little background on package scopes\n\nThe GitHub Packages Registry requires library authors to follow a few conventions when publishing packages. Understanding those conventions will add some color to how we're configuring your development environment.\n\nWhen publishing a package to the GitHub Packages Registry, package names must live [under a package scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scope). If you're interested in examples of scoped JavaScript packages, you need to look no further than Angular projects. If you look at [any projects that use Angular](https://github.com/sergiocruz/ng-karaoke/blob/master/package.json#L17), you'll notice that the names of the dependencies that Angular brings in have a scope (aka namespace, or a vendor prefix) of `@angular`, such as `@angular/core`, or `@angular/router`.\n\nThe scope that library authors must use can be either their GitHub usernames, or their GitHub organization's name, such as `@sergiocruz/library-name`, or `@my-org/library-name`.\n\n\n### Global npm configuration instead of project-level configuration\n\nIt's my personal preference to configure package consumption by project, thereby adding an `.npmrc` file to each of my projects that will consume private libraries from the GitHub Packages Registry.\n\nI prefer project-level configuration over a global npm configuration for the same reasons why I prefer to use scoped variables instead of global variables when writing JavaScript. Some folks coined this concept as the [Strictness Principle: Restrict the scope of what you do. Increase the scope as the need arises](https://medium.com/@fagnerbrack/the-strictness-principle-9997e483cafb). I feel similarly about configuration, it's easier to spot mistakes when they're scoped to a single project. It is possible, however, to configure npm globally to consume scoped packages from the GitHub Packages Registry, if that's what you prefer to do.\n\nYou should already have an npm configuration file under your user's home directory, namely `~/.npmrc`. Add the same lines mentioned above for the per-project configuration:\n\n```shell\n# File location: ~/.npmrc\n# Registry for the @my-org scope\n@my-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/\n```\n\nNow every time you install any packages under the `@my-org` scope anywhere on your machine, npm will know to fetch those packages from the GitHub Packages Registry.\n\n\n## Start consuming your packages\n\nAfter configuring your work environment, you'll be able to follow the same steps you usually do to install any packages.\n\nPull up your terminal and run:\n\n```shell\nnpm install @my-org/package-name --save\n```\n\nIf you prefer to use `yarn`, all the previous steps we followed should work seamlessly for it.\n\n```shell\nyarn add @my-org/package-name\n```\n\nIf you'd like a deeper dive into GitHub Packages, I would suggest browsing through their documentation to learn more about [how to configure npm for use with GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages), among other use cases.\n\nI hope this a helpful resource as you get a good handle on how to consume private npm libraries using GitHub Packages.

The backend returned meta data in its response. Nothing too out of the norm there, I just hadn't dealt with that using Restangular yet.\n\nTo put things into context, here is a sample response from the server:\n\n```javascript\n// Sample data from RESTful server\n{\n  data: [\n    { name: 'John' },\n    { name: 'Doe' }\n  ],\n  meta: {\n    records: 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Extracting `.data` object from backend response\n\nUsually I setup an interceptor to extract the `.data` object from an APIs response. I like doing that so I don't have to repeat myself too much throughout the rest of my code.\n\n```javascript\nangular\n  .module('app')\n  .config(['RestangularProvider', function(RestangularProvider) {\n    // Always extracts `data` from response\n    RestangularProvider.setResponseExtractor(function extractResponse(serverResponse, operation) {\n      return serverResponse.data;\n    });\n  }]);\n\n```\n\nThe code above just makes sure Restangular promises receive the unwrapped `.data` object. Feel free to visit \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mgonto/restangular#how-to-configure-them-globally\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Restangular's Documentation\u003C/a> to learn more about this works.\n\n## At last, the meta data\n\nThe above solution looks great! But how can you have access to both `.data` and `.meta` from your controllers now?\n\nThe above solution looks great! But how can you have access to `.data` and `.meta` from your controllers now? My 5-minute fix was to attach the `.meta` object to `.data` (it does feel ugly I am not going to lie):\n\n```javascript\nangular\n  .module('app')\n  .config(['RestangularProvider', function(RestangularProvider) {\n    // Always extracts `data` from response\n    RestangularProvider.setResponseExtractor(function extractResponse(serverResponse, operation) {\n    \n      // Response from server\n      var response = serverResponse.data;\n      \n      // Attaches meta object to the response object\n      if ('meta' in serverResponse) {\n        response.meta = serverResponse.meta;\n      }\n      \n      return response;\n    });\n  }]);\n\n```\n\nSimple right?\n\nThis solution didn't seem right to me at first. \"What if `serverResponse.data` is an array\" I thought to myself. This might break things right?  Nope, no breaking things. It turns out arrays in javascript were objects before they became arrays. So you can add properties to your arrays just fine.\n\nPS: I have only tested this solution in Chrome. Not sure how other browsers will like this idea.\n\nI'm also anxious to hear about more elegant solutions to this problem, as the more I dig through Restangular, the more n00b I feel about it.\n\nSo if you have any feedback, please drop a line below :)","src/content/blog/2015-04-15-restangular-metadata.md","698576bda6395e5a",{"html":376,"metadata":377},"\u003Cp>I love \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/mgonto/restangular\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Restangular\u003C/a> and all the functionality it provides, and its API is amazing!

But let's face it: when it comes to real life, *basic is never enough! On this article I will be covering a more realistic scenario:\n\nLet's suppose you wrote a \u003Ca href=\"https://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/controllers\" target=\"_blank\">SailsJS Controller\u003C/a> and a SailsJS Service. You got them to work together, and now you want to mock the service while testing your controller.\n\nThe problem is that SailsJS *magically* injects Services -- and Models, and everything else -- into the Controller, making it difficult to simply call `HelloController.index()` without *lifting SailsJS*. We need the dependencies to be in place (otherwise we will get a bunch of ugly *undefined is not a function* kind of errors.\n\nFortunately, *lifting SailsJS* in code is almost as easy as running `sails lift` on your command line, and that is exactly what we are going to do in order run our tests.\n\n## So... how do I mock services in my controllers?\n\n*I'm glad you asked!* First things first, pretend we already have a controller and a service in place: The controller is called `TestingServicesController` and the service is called `MyFirstService`.\n\n**Step 1:**\nStart by instantiating SailsJS in your test file:\n\n```javascript\nvar Sails = require('sails'),\n    sinon = require('sinon'),\n    assert = require('assert');\n```\n\n**Step 2:**\nLift SailsJS before executing each test and *lower* it after the test is executed:\n```javascript\n\nvar app,\n\ttestingServicesController;\n\n// Gets run before each test\nbefore(function beforeControllerTest(done) {\n\n  // Lift Sails and start the server\n  Sails.lift({\n\n    log: {\n      level: 'error'\n    },\n\n  }, function(err, sails) {\n  \n  \t// Instantiates new sails application\n    app = sails;\n    \n    // Instantiates controller\n    testingServicesController = app.controllers.testingservices;\n    \n    // Lets testing framework know async call is done\n    done(err, sails);\n  });\n});\n\n// Gets run after each test\nafter(function afterControllerTest(done){\n\n  // Destroys application\n  app.lower(done);\n  \n});\n```\n\n**Step 3:**\nMock service and test controller\n\n```javascript\nit('should have called mocked service', function() {\n\n  // Mocking our service\n  sinon.stub(app.services.myfirstservice, 'sayHello', function() {\n    return 'Hello I am the mocked Service';\n  });\n\n  // JSON object spy\n  var send = sinon.spy();\n\n  // Executes controller action\n  testingServicesController.index(null, {\n    'send': send\n  });\n\n  // Makes sure the mocked service was called\n  // instead of the real one\n  assert(send.called);\n  assert(send.calledWith('Our service has a message for you: Hello I am the mocked Service'));\n\n  // Restores our mock to the original service\n  app.services.myfirstservice.sayHello.restore();\n  // Notice that the above action this is very important\n  // because if the original action does not get restored,\n  // then this mock will be used in other tests\n  \n});\n```\n\n## Putting the pieces of the puzzle together\n\nBelow is what my code looks like when we put all three steps together:\n\n```javascript\nvar Sails = require('sails'),\n    sinon = require('sinon'),\n    assert = require('assert');\n\ndescribe('The TestingServices Controller', function() {\n\n  // app and testingServicesController \n  var app,\n      testingServicesController;\n\n  // Global before hook\n  before(function beforeControllerTest(done) {\n\n    // Lift Sails and start the server\n    Sails.lift({\n\n      log: {\n        level: 'error'\n      },\n\n    }, function(err, sails) {\n      app = sails;\n\n      // TestingServices controller\n      testingServicesController = app.controllers.testingservices;\n\n      done(err, sails);\n    });\n  });\n\n  after(function afterControllerTest(done){\n    app.lower(done);\n  });\n\n  describe('when we invoke the index action', function() {\n\n    before(function() {\n      // Mocking our service\n      sinon.stub(app.services.myfirstservice, 'sayHello', function() {\n        return 'Hello I am the mocked Service';\n      });\n    });\n\n    after(function() {\n      // Restores our mock to the original service\n      app.services.myfirstservice.sayHello.restore();\n    });\n\n    it('should have called mocked service', function() {\n\n      // JSON object spy\n      var send = sinon.spy();\n\n      // Executes controller action\n      testingServicesController.index(null, {\n        'send': send\n      });\n\n      // Makes sure the mocked service was called\n      // instead of the real one\n      assert(send.called);\n      assert(send.calledWith('Our service has a message for you: Hello I am the mocked Service'));\n    });\n\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n### Demo and code samples\nYou know you can always count on me when it comes to post my working code to GitHub!

Before I had all kinds of excuses, however AngularJS was built with testing in mind and that definitely made a huge difference.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity I will be using \u003Ca href=\"http://yeoman.io\" target=\"_blank\">Yeoman\u003C/a> for this tutorial. The \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular\" target=\"_blank\">Yeoman generator for AngularJS\u003C/a> definitely makes *testing AngularJS applications a breeze*. For example every time a controller is generated through the command line tool, this controller's test file is also generated automatically.\n\n## Scaffolding a new application\n\nLet's get started! First things first, make sure you have \u003Ca href=\"http://gruntjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">GruntJS\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://yeoman.io\" target=\"_blank\">Yeoman\u003C/a> and the \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular\" target=\"_blank\">AngularJS Generator\u003C/a> all installed globally:\n\n```shell\nnpm install -g grunt-cli\nnpm install -g yo\nnpm install -g generator-angular\n```\n\nOnce you are certain these three guys are installed, let's go ahead and scaffold a new AngularJS project:\n\n```shell\nmkdir angularjs-unit-test && cd $_\nyo angular angularjs-unit-test\n```\n\nThe AngularJS Genetator scaffolds a new application, it creates a `Main Controller` and its test by default. The controller file is located under `app/scripts/controllers/main.js` and its test file should be under `test/spec/controllers/main.js`.\n\nSince everything is already in place we should be able to start testing and generating code coverage reports right away, right? *Wrong!* We need to teak our app's configuration a little bit before we are able to sucessfuly run `grunt test`.\n\n## Setting up testing environment\n\nNow that we have our application laid out, let's just tweak a couple of files:\n\n**Step 1:**\nAdd `npm` dependencies that will allow `karma` to run tests and generate the code coverage report:\n\n```shell\nnpm install karma-jasmine --save-dev\nnpm install karma-phantomjs-launcher --save-dev\nnpm install karma-coverage --save-dev\n```\n\n*Attention: We are using \u003Ca href=\"http://jasmine.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">Jasmine\u003C/a> as our testing framework and \u003Ca href=\"http://phantomjs.org\" target=\"_blank\">PhantomJS\u003C/a> as the default browser to run our tests. Don't worry about installing PhantomJS though, as the \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-phantomjs-launcher\">karma-phantomjs-launcher\u003C/a> package includes a standalone executable `PhanthomJS` binary. Lastly, we are using \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage\" target=\"_blank\">karma-coverage\u003C/a> to generate our code coverage.*\n\n\u003Cbr />\n\n**Step 2:**\nStart by modifying the `browsers` flag within the `karma.conf.js` file, which should be located right on the root directory of your application.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Located on line 49 on my local version of karma.conf.js\nbrowsers: ['PhantomJS'],\n```\n\nIn this same file, add the following lines right after the `browsers` flag to make sure code coverage reports are generated every time the code is tested:\n\n```javascript\n// Code coverage report\nreporters: ['progress', 'coverage'],\npreprocessors: {\n  'app/scripts/**/*.js': ['coverage']\n},\ncoverageReporter: {\n  type: 'html',\n  dir: 'coverage'\n},\n\n// Don't forget to add 'karma-coverage' to your list of plugins\nplugins: [\n  'karma-jasmine',\n  'karma-coverage' // required for coverage\n]\n```\n\n\u003Cbr />\n\n**Step 3:**\nBy now we should be able to run our test and see the code coverage report!\n\nGo to your terminal and execute the following:\n\n```shell\ngrunt test\n```\n\nYou should see the following feedback on your screen:\n\n```shell\nRunning \"clean:server\" (clean) task\nCleaning .tmp...OK\n\nRunning \"concurrent:test\" (concurrent) task\n    \n    Running \"copy:styles\" (copy) task\n    Copied 1 files\n    \n    Done, without errors.\n    \n    \n    Execution Time (2014-05-22 20:22:18 UTC)\n    loading tasks  4ms  ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 29%\n    copy:styles ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 64%\n    Total 14ms\n    \nRunning \"autoprefixer:dist\" (autoprefixer) task\nPrefixed file \".tmp/styles/main.css\" created.\n\nRunning \"connect:test\" (connect) task\nStarted connect web server on 127.0.0.1:9001.\n\nRunning \"karma:unit\" (karma) task\nINFO [karma]: Karma v0.12.16 server started at http://localhost:8080/\nINFO [launcher]: Starting browser PhantomJS\nWARN [watcher]: Pattern \"/Users/scruz/Sites/angularjs-unit-test/test/mock/**/*.js\" does not match any file.\nINFO [PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X)]: Connected on socket WYv3ZzsuYUZWChR9mUGF with id 42383299\nPhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X): Executed 0 of 1 SUCCESS (0 secs / PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0 secs / PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0.015 secs / 0.011 secs)\n\nDone, without errors.\n\n\nExecution Time (2014-05-22 20:22:17 UTC)\nconcurrent:test    1.6s  ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 39%\nautoprefixer:dist  45ms  ▇ 1%\nkarma:unit         2.5s  ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 59%\nTotal 4.1s\n```\n\n\u003Cbr />\n\n## Finally! View your code coverage report\n\nIf everything ran successfuly for you as it did for me, you will notice that a directory called `coverage` was generated in the root of your application. Open the html file that was generated in your browser and it should look something like this:\n\n![](/images/blog/2014-05-22-04-49-33-pm.png)\n\u003Cbr />\n*File location: `coverage/PhantomJS(...)/index.html`*\n\nAnd that's it for now! I wish I had this guide when I first had to generate a code coverage report in my Yeoman scaffolded application. So I hope this helps you as much as it did me.\n\n### Demo\nIf you are a code sample kind of person, don't worry I've got you covered!

It only takes a few seconds they said.\n\n*And they were right for the most part! Well, maybe seconds is an exaggeration but we can definitely achieve this with very few minutes*\n\nSo you fired up your first `hello world` app using \u003Ca href=\"https://sailsjs.org\" target=\"_blank\">SailsJS\u003C/a>, it was super simple and you started wondering if testing your app would be as simple. Soon after you realized this was not the case and much like everything else related to testing in JavaScript there is not just one right answer.\n\nPerhaps you may have much more experience with SailsJS and have way gone beyond the `hello world` phase and now is time to make sure your application is reliable. Unit testing is part of the solution when it comes to code reliability.\n\n***Before we start:** Are you a total SailsJS n00b? Follow the official \u003Ca href=\"https://sailsjs.org/#!getStarted\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Started\u003C/a> guide to get SailsJS installed before proceeding.*\n\n### Without further ado, let's get started:\n\n**Step 1:**\nAdd the following dependencies to your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mocha --save-dev\nnpm install assert --save-dev\nnpm install sinon --save-dev\nnpm install grunt-mocha-istanbul --save-dev\n```\n\n**Step 2:**\nAdd a `/test` directory to the root directory of your application that mimics the format of the `/api` directory. Your new root directory structure should look something like this:\n\n```\n/api\n/assets\n/config\n/test\n  /adapters\n  /controllers\n  /models\n  /policies\n  /services\n/views\n.gitignore\napp.js\nGruntfile.js\npackage.json\nREADME.md\n```\n\n**Step 3:**\nModify your `Gruntfile.js`\n\nFirst add the following snippet at the end of your `grunt.initConfig()` *(located around line 414 in my case)*\n\n```javascript\nmocha_istanbul: {\n  coverage: {\n    src: 'test', // the folder, not the files\n    options: {\n      coverageFolder: 'coverage',\n      mask: '**/*.spec.js',\n      root: 'api/'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd add the two following snippet right before the file ends: *(again around line 496 in my case)*\n\n```javascript\n// Adds \"grunt-mocha-istanbul\" npm task\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-mocha-istanbul');\n\n// Adding test task enabling \"grunt test\" command\ngrunt.registerTask('test', [\n  'mocha_istanbul:coverage'\n]);\n```\n\n**Step 4:**\nCreate your first test\n\nFor the sake of simplicity let's create a HelloController and its test:\n\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Sails Controller: HelloController\n * File location: api/controllers/HelloController.js\n */\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  index: function(req, res) {\n    res.send('Hello World');\n  }\n  \n};\n```\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Test File: Testing HelloController\n * File location: test/controllers/HelloController.spec.js\n */\nvar HelloController = require('../../api/controllers/HelloController'),\n    sinon = require('sinon'),\n    assert = require('assert');\n\ndescribe('The Hello Controller', function() {\n  describe('when we invoke the index action', function() {\n    it('should return hello world message', function() {\n\n      // Mocking res.send() method by using a sinon spy\n      var send = sinon.spy();\n\n      // Executes controller action\n      HelloController.index(null, {\n        'send': send\n      });\n\n      // Asserts send() method was called and that it was called\n      // with the correct arguments: 'Hello World'\n      assert(send.called);\n      assert(send.calledWith('Hello World'));\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n**Step 5:**\nExecute test\n\nExecute the following command on your Terminal:\n\n```bash\ngrunt test\n```\n\nThe feedback you will receive should be similar to the following:\n\n```bash\nRunning \"mocha_istanbul:coverage\" (mocha_istanbul) task\n\n  ․\n\n  1 passing (6ms)\n\n===================================================================\nWriting coverage object [/Users/scruz/Sites/sails-unit-test/coverage/coverage.json]\nWriting coverage reports at [/Users/scruz/Sites/sails-unit-test/coverage]\n===================================================================\n\n======================== Coverage summary =========================\nStatements   : 100% ( 2/2 )\nBranches     : 100% ( 0/0 )\nFunctions    : 100% ( 1/1 )\nLines        : 100% ( 2/2 )\n===================================================================\n>> Done. Check coverage folder.\n\nDone, without errors.\n```\n\nAlso by now you may have realized the `/coverage` folder was generated on your application's root directory. Open the following html file on your browser to see your current code coverage: `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`\n\n**And... we're all done!**\n\nI hope this helped you as much as it helped me!  Feel free to contact me with any questions.\n\n**Demo:** a working code sample for what we have accomplished in this tutorial is available on my GitHub account:\n\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/sergiocruz/sails-unit-test\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/sergiocruz/sails-unit-test\u003C/a>\n\nEnjoy!","src/content/blog/2014-05-21-unit-test-sails.md","64ad0499a1e76b98",{"html":477,"metadata":478},"\u003Ch1 id=\"unit-testing-javascript-is-easy-they-said-it-only-takes-a-few-seconds-they-said\">Unit testing JavaScript is easy they said.

When I wrote this post getting a testing environment setup was not easy at all. So I decided to write this article describing some basic steps.\n\n## With Create React App\n\nIf you used [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to generate your project, then your project is pre-configured to generate [Code Coverage Reports](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#coverage-reporting). To generate a report, run this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm test -- --coverage\n```\n\nNotice a new directory called `/coverage` will be created at the root of your project.\n\n## Configuring Jest to run React Tests\n\n**Step 1:**  Get your new project setup (`npm init`)\n\n**Step 2:** Bring in npm dependencies:\n\n- `npm install --save-dev jest`\n- `npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env`\n\n**Step3:** Add the following lines to your `package.json` file:\n\n```javascript\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"test\": \"jest\",\n},\n\"jest\": {\n  \"collectCoverageFrom\": [\n    \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\",\n    \"!src/**/*.d.ts\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Write your component:\n\n```jsx\n// File location: app/components/App.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Ch1>Hello World\u003C/h1>\n    \u003C/div>\n  )\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  \u003CApp />,\n  document.getElementById('app')\n);\n\n```\n\n**Step 5:** Create a `__tests__` directory on your project's root and write your first test.\n\n_**Protip:** Jest's conventions suggest using a directory called `__tests__` on your project's root. Good news is you can change that, [check out the docs](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html#config-testdirectoryname-string)._\n\n```javascript\n// File location: __tests__/app/App-test.js\njest.dontMock('../../app/components/App');\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactTestUtils from 'react-dom/test-utils';\nimport App from '../../app/components/App';\n\ndescribe('App', function() {\n\n  it('renders with correct text', function() {\n\n    const app = ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(\n      \u003CApp />\n    );\n\n    const appNode = React.findDOMNode(app);\n\t\n    // Asserts that the text in the \u003Ch1> tag\n    // is equal to \"Hello World\" (like our App component)\n    expect(\n      appNode.querySelector('h1').textContent\n    ).toEqual('Hello World');\n\n  });\n\n});\n\n```\n\n**Step 6:** Run tests and you should be all done: `npm test`\n\nPS: Don't forget to checkout the `coverage` directory. It contains all your code coverage reports.\n\n### A word on conventions\n\nFor my projects, I decided to have an `app` directory where all my code lives. I then replicate the `app` directory within `__tests__` directory. That way all my files and test files have the same name, except the test file names end with a `-test` after its name. For example: the component file `app/App.js` would have its test in the following location: `__tests__/app/App-test.js`.\n\n### Code sample\nIf you're anything like me, you like seeing code samples. Feel free to check out the app I have been writing. It uses some of the conventions I've described in this post: https://github.com/sergiocruz/react-connect4","src/content/blog/2015-08-02-react-jest-unit-test.md","d2b3e67f0c1a9019",{"html":507,"metadata":508},"\u003Cp>The recommended testing framework for \u003Ca href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React\u003C/a> is \u003Ca href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest\u003C/a>.
