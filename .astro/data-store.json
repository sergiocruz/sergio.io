Over the past several years, I've had the privilege of leading teams through rapid growth phases, from small startup squads to large enterprise organizations. Here are the key lessons I've learned about building and scaling high-performing engineering teams.\n\n## The Foundation: Culture First\n\nBefore you hire your first engineer or implement any process, you need to establish a strong engineering culture. Culture isn't something you can retrofit—it needs to be intentional from day one.\n\n### Define Your Engineering Values\n\nStart by clearly defining what your engineering organization stands for:\n\n- **Quality**: We ship code we're proud of\n- **Collaboration**: We succeed together or fail together  \n- **Growth**: We invest in continuous learning and improvement\n- **Impact**: We build things that matter to users and the business\n\n### Hire for Culture Add, Not Just Culture Fit\n\nAs you scale, resist the temptation to hire people who are exactly like your existing team. Instead, look for candidates who will add to your culture while sharing your core values.\n\n## The Process: Systems That Scale\n\n### 1. Establish Clear Engineering Standards\n\nDocument your coding standards, review processes, and technical guidelines early. This includes:\n\n- Code style guides and linting rules\n- Testing requirements and coverage goals\n- Security and performance standards\n- Documentation expectations\n\n### 2. Implement Effective Code Review\n\nCode review is your quality gate and knowledge sharing mechanism. Establish clear expectations:\n\n- All code must be reviewed by at least one other engineer\n- Reviews should focus on correctness, maintainability, and learning\n- Use automated tools to catch style and basic issues\n- Keep review cycles short (ideally \u003C 24 hours)\n\n### 3. Build Robust CI/CD Pipelines\n\nAutomation becomes critical as teams grow. Invest in:\n\n- Automated testing at all levels (unit, integration, e2e)\n- Automated deployments with rollback capabilities\n- Feature flags for safe, gradual rollouts\n- Monitoring and alerting that catches issues early\n\n## The People: Growing Leaders at Every Level\n\n### Mentorship Programs\n\nCreate formal and informal mentorship opportunities:\n\n- Pair junior engineers with senior team members\n- Encourage cross-team knowledge sharing\n- Provide resources for technical and career growth\n\n### Career Progression Paths\n\nBe transparent about career advancement:\n\n- Create clear job ladders for both IC and management tracks\n- Provide regular feedback and growth opportunities\n- Support engineers who want to try different roles or specializations\n\n### Psychological Safety\n\nFoster an environment where people feel safe to:\n\n- Ask questions without judgment\n- Admit mistakes and learn from them\n- Propose new ideas and challenge existing approaches\n- Take calculated risks\n\n## The Challenges: What to Watch Out For\n\n### Communication Overhead\n\nAs teams grow, communication becomes exponentially more complex. Combat this with:\n\n- Clear documentation and decision logs\n- Regular all-hands and team sync meetings\n- Cross-functional embedded teams\n- Transparent planning and prioritization processes\n\n### Technical Debt\n\nRapid growth often leads to shortcuts. Manage technical debt by:\n\n- Allocating time in each sprint for refactoring\n- Tracking technical debt as you would customer-facing features\n- Making architectural decisions that support future growth\n- Regular architecture reviews and tech talks\n\n### Maintaining Innovation\n\nDon't let process kill creativity. Preserve innovation through:\n\n- Hack days and exploration time\n- 20% time for experimental projects\n- Innovation challenges and internal conferences\n- Encouraging experimentation with new technologies\n\n## Key Metrics to Track\n\nAs you scale, measure what matters:\n\n- **Developer Velocity**: Lead time from commit to production\n- **Quality**: Bug rates, customer-reported issues, uptime\n- **Engagement**: Employee satisfaction, retention rates\n- **Learning**: Internal mobility, skill development\n\n## Conclusion\n\nScaling engineering teams is as much about people and process as it is about technology. The most successful organizations I've seen focus on building strong foundations early, then evolving their practices as they grow.\n\nRemember that scaling is not just about adding more people—it's about building systems, processes, and culture that enable teams to be effective at any size. Start with strong foundations, measure what matters, and always prioritize the growth and well-being of your team members.\n\nThe investment you make in scaling thoughtfully will pay dividends as your organization continues to grow and tackle increasingly complex challenges.","src/content/blog/building-scalable-teams.md","aa23dfb380148d41",{"html":296,"metadata":297},"\u003Ch1 id=\"building-scalable-engineering-teams\">Building Scalable Engineering Teams\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Scaling an engineering team is one of the most challenging aspects of growing a technology company.

Before I had all kinds of excuses, however AngularJS was built with testing in mind and that definitely made a huge difference.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity I will be using \u003Ca href=\"http://yeoman.io\" target=\"_blank\">Yeoman\u003C/a> for this tutorial. The \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular\" target=\"_blank\">Yeoman generator for AngularJS\u003C/a> definitely makes *testing AngularJS applications a breeze*. For example every time a controller is generated through the command line tool, this controller's test file is also generated automatically.\n\n## Scaffolding a new application\n\nLet's get started! First things first, make sure you have \u003Ca href=\"http://gruntjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">GruntJS\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://yeoman.io\" target=\"_blank\">Yeoman\u003C/a> and the \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular\" target=\"_blank\">AngularJS Generator\u003C/a> all installed globally:\n\n```shell\nnpm install -g grunt-cli\nnpm install -g yo\nnpm install -g generator-angular\n```\n\nOnce you are certain these three guys are installed, let's go ahead and scaffold a new AngularJS project:\n\n```shell\nmkdir angularjs-unit-test && cd $_\nyo angular angularjs-unit-test\n```\n\nThe AngularJS Genetator scaffolds a new application, it creates a `Main Controller` and its test by default. The controller file is located under `app/scripts/controllers/main.js` and its test file should be under `test/spec/controllers/main.js`.\n\nSince everything is already in place we should be able to start testing and generating code coverage reports right away, right? *Wrong!* We need to teak our app's configuration a little bit before we are able to sucessfuly run `grunt test`.\n\n## Setting up testing environment\n\nNow that we have our application laid out, let's just tweak a couple of files:\n\n**Step 1:**\nAdd `npm` dependencies that will allow `karma` to run tests and generate the code coverage report:\n\n```shell\nnpm install karma-jasmine --save-dev\nnpm install karma-phantomjs-launcher --save-dev\nnpm install karma-coverage --save-dev\n```\n\n*Attention: We are using \u003Ca href=\"http://jasmine.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">Jasmine\u003C/a> as our testing framework and \u003Ca href=\"http://phantomjs.org\" target=\"_blank\">PhantomJS\u003C/a> as the default browser to run our tests. Don't worry about installing PhantomJS though, as the \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-phantomjs-launcher\">karma-phantomjs-launcher\u003C/a> package includes a standalone executable `PhanthomJS` binary. Lastly, we are using \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage\" target=\"_blank\">karma-coverage\u003C/a> to generate our code coverage.*\n\n\u003Cbr />\n\n**Step 2:**\nStart by modifying the `browsers` flag within the `karma.conf.js` file, which should be located right on the root directory of your application.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Located on line 49 on my local version of karma.conf.js\nbrowsers: ['PhantomJS'],\n```\n\nIn this same file, add the following lines right after the `browsers` flag to make sure code coverage reports are generated every time the code is tested:\n\n```javascript\n// Code coverage report\nreporters: ['progress', 'coverage'],\npreprocessors: {\n  'app/scripts/**/*.js': ['coverage']\n},\ncoverageReporter: {\n  type: 'html',\n  dir: 'coverage'\n},\n\n// Don't forget to add 'karma-coverage' to your list of plugins\nplugins: [\n  'karma-jasmine',\n  'karma-coverage' // required for coverage\n]\n```\n\n\u003Cbr />\n\n**Step 3:**\nBy now we should be able to run our test and see the code coverage report!\n\nGo to your terminal and execute the following:\n\n```shell\ngrunt test\n```\n\nYou should see the following feedback on your screen:\n\n```shell\nRunning \"clean:server\" (clean) task\nCleaning .tmp...OK\n\nRunning \"concurrent:test\" (concurrent) task\n    \n    Running \"copy:styles\" (copy) task\n    Copied 1 files\n    \n    Done, without errors.\n    \n    \n    Execution Time (2014-05-22 20:22:18 UTC)\n    loading tasks  4ms  ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 29%\n    copy:styles ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 64%\n    Total 14ms\n    \nRunning \"autoprefixer:dist\" (autoprefixer) task\nPrefixed file \".tmp/styles/main.css\" created.\n\nRunning \"connect:test\" (connect) task\nStarted connect web server on 127.0.0.1:9001.\n\nRunning \"karma:unit\" (karma) task\nINFO [karma]: Karma v0.12.16 server started at http://localhost:8080/\nINFO [launcher]: Starting browser PhantomJS\nWARN [watcher]: Pattern \"/Users/scruz/Sites/angularjs-unit-test/test/mock/**/*.js\" does not match any file.\nINFO [PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X)]: Connected on socket WYv3ZzsuYUZWChR9mUGF with id 42383299\nPhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X): Executed 0 of 1 SUCCESS (0 secs / PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0 secs / PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0.015 secs / 0.011 secs)\n\nDone, without errors.\n\n\nExecution Time (2014-05-22 20:22:17 UTC)\nconcurrent:test    1.6s  ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 39%\nautoprefixer:dist  45ms  ▇ 1%\nkarma:unit         2.5s  ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 59%\nTotal 4.1s\n```\n\n\u003Cbr />\n\n## Finally! View your code coverage report\n\nIf everything ran successfuly for you as it did for me, you will notice that a directory called `coverage` was generated in the root of your application. Open the html file that was generated in your browser and it should look something like this:\n\n![](/images/blog/2014-05-22-04-49-33-pm.png)\n\u003Cbr />\n*File location: `coverage/PhantomJS(...)/index.html`*\n\nAnd that's it for now! I wish I had this guide when I first had to generate a code coverage report in my Yeoman scaffolded application. So I hope this helps you as much as it did me.\n\n### Demo\nIf you are a code sample kind of person, don't worry I've got you covered!

It only takes a few seconds they said.\n\n*And they were right for the most part! Well, maybe seconds is an exaggeration but we can definitely achieve this with very few minutes*\n\nSo you fired up your first `hello world` app using \u003Ca href=\"https://sailsjs.org\" target=\"_blank\">SailsJS\u003C/a>, it was super simple and you started wondering if testing your app would be as simple. Soon after you realized this was not the case and much like everything else related to testing in JavaScript there is not just one right answer.\n\nPerhaps you may have much more experience with SailsJS and have way gone beyond the `hello world` phase and now is time to make sure your application is reliable. Unit testing is part of the solution when it comes to code reliability.\n\n***Before we start:** Are you a total SailsJS n00b? Follow the official \u003Ca href=\"https://sailsjs.org/#!getStarted\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Started\u003C/a> guide to get SailsJS installed before proceeding.*\n\n### Without further ado, let's get started:\n\n**Step 1:**\nAdd the following dependencies to your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mocha --save-dev\nnpm install assert --save-dev\nnpm install sinon --save-dev\nnpm install grunt-mocha-istanbul --save-dev\n```\n\n**Step 2:**\nAdd a `/test` directory to the root directory of your application that mimics the format of the `/api` directory. Your new root directory structure should look something like this:\n\n```\n/api\n/assets\n/config\n/test\n  /adapters\n  /controllers\n  /models\n  /policies\n  /services\n/views\n.gitignore\napp.js\nGruntfile.js\npackage.json\nREADME.md\n```\n\n**Step 3:**\nModify your `Gruntfile.js`\n\nFirst add the following snippet at the end of your `grunt.initConfig()` *(located around line 414 in my case)*\n\n```javascript\nmocha_istanbul: {\n  coverage: {\n    src: 'test', // the folder, not the files\n    options: {\n      coverageFolder: 'coverage',\n      mask: '**/*.spec.js',\n      root: 'api/'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd add the two following snippet right before the file ends: *(again around line 496 in my case)*\n\n```javascript\n// Adds \"grunt-mocha-istanbul\" npm task\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-mocha-istanbul');\n\n// Adding test task enabling \"grunt test\" command\ngrunt.registerTask('test', [\n  'mocha_istanbul:coverage'\n]);\n```\n\n**Step 4:**\nCreate your first test\n\nFor the sake of simplicity let's create a HelloController and its test:\n\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Sails Controller: HelloController\n * File location: api/controllers/HelloController.js\n */\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  index: function(req, res) {\n    res.send('Hello World');\n  }\n  \n};\n```\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Test File: Testing HelloController\n * File location: test/controllers/HelloController.spec.js\n */\nvar HelloController = require('../../api/controllers/HelloController'),\n    sinon = require('sinon'),\n    assert = require('assert');\n\ndescribe('The Hello Controller', function() {\n  describe('when we invoke the index action', function() {\n    it('should return hello world message', function() {\n\n      // Mocking res.send() method by using a sinon spy\n      var send = sinon.spy();\n\n      // Executes controller action\n      HelloController.index(null, {\n        'send': send\n      });\n\n      // Asserts send() method was called and that it was called\n      // with the correct arguments: 'Hello World'\n      assert(send.called);\n      assert(send.calledWith('Hello World'));\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n**Step 5:**\nExecute test\n\nExecute the following command on your Terminal:\n\n```bash\ngrunt test\n```\n\nThe feedback you will receive should be similar to the following:\n\n```bash\nRunning \"mocha_istanbul:coverage\" (mocha_istanbul) task\n\n  ․\n\n  1 passing (6ms)\n\n===================================================================\nWriting coverage object [/Users/scruz/Sites/sails-unit-test/coverage/coverage.json]\nWriting coverage reports at [/Users/scruz/Sites/sails-unit-test/coverage]\n===================================================================\n\n======================== Coverage summary =========================\nStatements   : 100% ( 2/2 )\nBranches     : 100% ( 0/0 )\nFunctions    : 100% ( 1/1 )\nLines        : 100% ( 2/2 )\n===================================================================\n>> Done. Check coverage folder.\n\nDone, without errors.\n```\n\nAlso by now you may have realized the `/coverage` folder was generated on your application's root directory. Open the following html file on your browser to see your current code coverage: `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`\n\n**And... we're all done!**\n\nI hope this helped you as much as it helped me!

Here are the real-world lessons, hard-won insights, and practical advice from implementing microservices at scale.\n\n## When Microservices Make Sense (And When They Don't)\n\n### The Right Time for Microservices\n\nMicroservices aren't a silver bullet. They solve specific problems and create others. Consider microservices when:\n\n- **Team scaling**: You have multiple teams working on the same codebase and coordination overhead is slowing development\n- **Technology diversity**: Different parts of your system have fundamentally different technical requirements\n- **Independent scaling**: Different components have vastly different scaling needs\n- **Organizational boundaries**: Conway's Law suggests your architecture will mirror your organization structure\n\n### When to Stick with the Monolith\n\nStay monolithic when:\n\n- **Small teams**: You have fewer than 8-10 engineers\n- **Uncertain domain boundaries**: You're still figuring out your business domain\n- **Simple use cases**: Your application doesn't have complex scaling or technology requirements\n- **Limited operational expertise**: You don't have the DevOps maturity to handle distributed systems\n\n## The Migration Strategy That Actually Works\n\n### Start with the Database\n\nMost \"microservices\" projects fail because they split the application but keep a shared database.

Split along business capabilities:\n\n```\n❌ Bad: Technical splitting\n- Database Service\n- API Service  \n- UI Service\n\n✅ Good: Business capability splitting\n- User Management Service\n- Order Processing Service\n- Inventory Service\n- Notification Service\n```\n\n## Communication Patterns That Scale\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\nChoose your communication pattern carefully:\n\n**Synchronous (HTTP/gRPC)** for:\n- Real-time queries\n- Simple request-response patterns\n- When you need immediate consistency\n\n**Asynchronous (Message queues)** for:\n- Event-driven workflows\n- Eventual consistency scenarios\n- High-throughput scenarios\n\n### Event-Driven Architecture\n\nImplement event sourcing for complex workflows:\n\n```javascript\n// Order Service publishes events\nclass OrderService {\n  async createOrder(orderData) {\n    const order = await this.repository.save(orderData)\n    \n    // Publish event for other services\n    await this.eventBus.publish('order.created', {\n      orderId: order.id,\n      userId: order.userId,\n      amount: order.amount,\n      timestamp: new Date()\n    })\n    \n    return order\n  }\n}\n\n// Inventory Service reacts to events\nclass InventoryService {\n  async handleOrderCreated(event) {\n    await this.reserveItems(event.orderId, event.items)\n    \n    await this.eventBus.publish('inventory.reserved', {\n      orderId: event.orderId,\n      items: event.items\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Circuit Breaker Pattern\n\nImplement circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures:\n\n```javascript\nclass CircuitBreaker {\n  constructor(threshold = 5, timeout = 60000) {\n    this.threshold = threshold\n    this.timeout = timeout\n    this.failureCount = 0\n    this.state = 'CLOSED' // CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n    this.nextAttempt = Date.now()\n  }\n  \n  async call(fn) {\n    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {\n      if (Date.now() \u003C this.nextAttempt) {\n        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN')\n      }\n      this.state = 'HALF_OPEN'\n    }\n    \n    try {\n      const result = await fn()\n      this.onSuccess()\n      return result\n    } catch (error) {\n      this.onFailure()\n      throw error\n    }\n  }\n  \n  onSuccess() {\n    this.failureCount = 0\n    this.state = 'CLOSED'\n  }\n  \n  onFailure() {\n    this.failureCount++\n    if (this.failureCount >= this.threshold) {\n      this.state = 'OPEN'\n      this.nextAttempt = Date.now() + this.timeout\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Data Management Challenges\n\n### Distributed Transactions\n\nAvoid distributed transactions. Use the Saga pattern instead:\n\n```javascript\n// Order processing saga\nclass OrderSaga {\n  async execute(orderData) {\n    const compensations = []\n    \n    try {\n      // Step 1: Reserve inventory\n      const reservation = await this.inventoryService.reserve(orderData.items)\n      compensations.push(() => this.inventoryService.release(reservation.id))\n      \n      // Step 2: Process payment\n      const payment = await this.paymentService.charge(orderData.payment)\n      compensations.push(() => this.paymentService.refund(payment.id))\n      \n      // Step 3: Create order\n      const order = await this.orderService.create(orderData)\n      \n      return order\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Execute compensations in reverse order\n      for (const compensation of compensations.reverse()) {\n        try {\n          await compensation()\n        } catch (compensationError) {\n          console.error('Compensation failed:', compensationError)\n        }\n      }\n      throw error\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data Consistency Strategies\n\n**Eventual Consistency**: Accept that data won't always be immediately consistent across services.\n\n```javascript\n// Event-driven eventual consistency\nclass UserService {\n  async updateUser(userId, userData) {\n    const user = await this.repository.update(userId, userData)\n    \n    // Other services will eventually sync\n    await this.eventBus.publish('user.updated', {\n      userId: user.id,\n      email: user.email,\n      name: user.name\n    })\n    \n    return user\n  }\n}\n\nclass OrderService {\n  async handleUserUpdated(event) {\n    // Update local user cache\n    await this.userCache.update(event.userId, {\n      email: event.email,\n      name: event.name\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Operational Complexity\n\n### Observability is Critical\n\nYou can't manage what you can't see. Implement comprehensive observability:\n\n```javascript\n// Distributed tracing\nconst opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/api')\n\nclass UserService {\n  async getUser(userId) {\n    const span = opentelemetry.trace.getActiveSpan()\n    span?.setAttributes({\n      'user.id': userId,\n      'service.name': 'user-service'\n    })\n    \n    try {\n      const user = await this.repository.findById(userId)\n      span?.setStatus({ code: opentelemetry.SpanStatusCode.OK })\n      return user\n    } catch (error) {\n      span?.setStatus({ \n        code: opentelemetry.SpanStatusCode.ERROR,\n        message: error.message \n      })\n      throw error\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Service Mesh for Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\nUse service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for:\n- Service-to-service authentication\n- Traffic management\n- Observability\n- Security policies\n\n```yaml\n# Istio virtual service for canary deployment\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\nkind: VirtualService\nmetadata:\n  name: order-service\nspec:\n  hosts:\n  - order-service\n  http:\n  - match:\n    - headers:\n        canary:\n          exact: \"true\"\n    route:\n    - destination:\n        host: order-service\n        subset: v2\n  - route:\n    - destination:\n        host: order-service\n        subset: v1\n      weight: 90\n    - destination:\n        host: order-service\n        subset: v2\n      weight: 10\n```\n\n## Deployment and DevOps\n\n### CI/CD Per Service\n\nEach service should have its own deployment pipeline:\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/user-service.yml\nname: User Service CI/CD\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'services/user-service/**'\n      \njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Run tests\n        run: |\n          cd services/user-service\n          npm test\n          \n  deploy:\n    needs: test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes\n        run: |\n          kubectl apply -f services/user-service/k8s/\n```\n\n### Database Migrations\n\nHandle database migrations carefully in microservices:\n\n```javascript\n// Backward-compatible migrations\n// Phase 1: Add new column (optional)\nALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(20);\n\n// Phase 2: Deploy application code that writes to both columns\n\n// Phase 3: Migrate existing data\nUPDATE users SET phone_number = legacy_phone WHERE phone_number IS NULL;\n\n// Phase 4: Make new column required\nALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN phone_number SET NOT NULL;\n\n// Phase 5: Remove old column\nALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN legacy_phone;\n```\n\n## Testing Strategies\n\n### Contract Testing\n\nUse contract testing to ensure service compatibility:\n\n```javascript\n// User service contract\nconst userServiceContract = {\n  request: {\n    method: 'GET',\n    path: '/users/123'\n  },\n  response: {\n    status: 200,\n    body: {\n      id: '123',\n      name: 'John Doe',\n      email: 'john@example.com'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Order service consumer test\ndescribe('User Service Integration', () => {\n  it('should get user details', async () => {\n    // Mock based on contract\n    nock('http://user-service')\n      .get('/users/123')\n      .reply(200, userServiceContract.response.body)\n      \n    const user = await userClient.getUser('123')\n    expect(user.name).toBe('John Doe')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### Integration Testing\n\nTest service interactions with test containers:\n\n```javascript\n// Integration test with real dependencies\ndescribe('Order Service Integration', () => {\n  let postgres, redis, userService\n  \n  beforeAll(async () => {\n    postgres = await new PostgreSqlContainer().start()\n    redis = await new RedisContainer().start()\n    userService = await new GenericContainer('user-service').start()\n  })\n  \n  afterAll(async () => {\n    await postgres.stop()\n    await redis.stop()\n    await userService.stop()\n  })\n  \n  it('should create order with user validation', async () => {\n    // Test with real dependencies\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\n\n### 1. Distributed Monolith\n\n**Problem**: Services that are too tightly coupled\n\n**Solution**: Design for independence. Each service should be deployable separately.\n\n### 2. Premature Optimization\n\n**Problem**: Starting with microservices from day one\n\n**Solution**: Start with a modular monolith, extract services when needed.\n\n### 3. Shared Databases\n\n**Problem**: Services sharing the same database\n\n**Solution**: Database per service. Use events for data synchronization.\n\n### 4. Synchronous Everything\n\n**Problem**: Using HTTP for all service communication\n\n**Solution**: Use async messaging for non-critical paths.\n\n### 5. Ignoring Network Partitions\n\n**Problem**: Not handling network failures gracefully\n\n**Solution**: Implement circuit breakers, timeouts, and bulkheads.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMicroservices can solve real problems, but they're not free. They trade code complexity for operational complexity. Before adopting microservices, ensure you have:\n\n1. **Clear business justification**: Teams, scaling, or technology diversity needs\n2. **Operational maturity**: DevOps capabilities, monitoring, and automation\n3. **Domain understanding**: Clear service boundaries based on business capabilities\n4. **Gradual migration plan**: Strangler fig pattern rather than big-bang rewrite\n\nRemember: a well-designed monolith is better than a poorly designed microservices architecture. Start simple, and evolve when you have clear evidence that microservices will solve your specific problems.\n\nThe goal isn't to build microservices—it's to build systems that enable your teams to deliver value quickly and reliably. Sometimes that's a monolith, sometimes it's microservices, and often it's something in between.","src/content/blog/microservices-lessons.md","563ed504c2ba5281",{"html":447,"metadata":448},"\u003Ch1 id=\"microservices-lessons-from-the-trenches\">Microservices: Lessons from the Trenches\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>After several years of building and maintaining microservices architectures across different organizations, I’ve learned that the journey from monolith to microservices is rarely straightforward.

As we move through 2024, several key patterns have emerged that are shaping the future of React development. Let's explore these patterns and understand when and how to apply them effectively.\n\n## Server Components: The Game Changer\n\nReact Server Components represent one of the most significant shifts in how we think about React applications. They allow us to render components on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Server components don't add to your client-side JavaScript bundle\n- **Direct Database Access**: Fetch data directly in your components without API routes\n- **Improved Performance**: Faster initial page loads and better Core Web Vitals\n\n### Example Pattern\n\n```jsx\n// app/posts/page.js (Server Component)\nimport { getPosts } from '@/lib/database'\nimport PostList from './PostList'\n\nexport default async function PostsPage() {\n  const posts = await getPosts() // Direct database access\n  \n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Ch1>Latest Posts\u003C/h1>\n      \u003CPostList posts={posts} />\n    \u003C/div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Concurrent Features and Suspense\n\nReact's concurrent features, including Suspense boundaries and streaming, enable better user experiences through progressive loading.\n\n### Suspense for Data Fetching\n\n```jsx\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport PostList from './PostList'\nimport PostSkeleton from './PostSkeleton'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003CSuspense fallback={\u003CPostSkeleton />}>\n      \u003CPostList />\n    \u003C/Suspense>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Error Boundaries with Suspense\n\n```jsx\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary'\n\nfunction ErrorFallback({error, resetErrorBoundary}) {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv role=\"alert\">\n      \u003Ch2>Something went wrong:\u003C/h2>\n      \u003Cpre>{error.message}\u003C/pre>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>Try again\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003CErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>\n      \u003CSuspense fallback={\u003CLoading />}>\n        \u003CDataComponent />\n      \u003C/Suspense>\n    \u003C/ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Hook Patterns\n\n### Custom Hooks for Data Fetching\n\n```jsx\nfunction usePost(id) {\n  const [post, setPost] = useState(null)\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null)\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function fetchPost() {\n      try {\n        setLoading(true)\n        const response = await fetch(`/api/posts/${id}`)\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch')\n        const postData = await response.json()\n        setPost(postData)\n      } catch (err) {\n        setError(err.message)\n      } finally {\n        setLoading(false)\n      }\n    }\n    \n    fetchPost()\n  }, [id])\n  \n  return { post, loading, error }\n}\n```\n\n### Compound Component Pattern\n\n```jsx\nfunction Modal({ children, onClose }) {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"modal-overlay\" onClick={onClose}>\n      \u003Cdiv className=\"modal-content\" onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}>\n        {children}\n      \u003C/div>\n    \u003C/div>\n  )\n}\n\nModal.Header = function ModalHeader({ children }) {\n  return \u003Cdiv className=\"modal-header\">{children}\u003C/div>\n}\n\nModal.Body = function ModalBody({ children }) {\n  return \u003Cdiv className=\"modal-body\">{children}\u003C/div>\n}\n\nModal.Footer = function ModalFooter({ children }) {\n  return \u003Cdiv className=\"modal-footer\">{children}\u003C/div>\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003CModal onClose={handleClose}>\n      \u003CModal.Header>\n        \u003Ch2>Confirm Action\u003C/h2>\n      \u003C/Modal.Header>\n      \u003CModal.Body>\n        \u003Cp>Are you sure you want to proceed?\u003C/p>\n      \u003C/Modal.Body>\n      \u003CModal.Footer>\n        \u003Cbutton onClick={handleConfirm}>Confirm\u003C/button>\n        \u003Cbutton onClick={handleClose}>Cancel\u003C/button>\n      \u003C/Modal.Footer>\n    \u003C/Modal>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## State Management Evolution\n\n### Zustand for Simple State\n\n```jsx\nimport { create } from 'zustand'\n\nconst useStore = create((set) => ({\n  count: 0,\n  increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),\n  decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),\n  reset: () => set({ count: 0 }),\n}))\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useStore()\n  \n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cspan>{count}\u003C/span>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={increment}>+\u003C/button>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={decrement}>-\u003C/button>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={reset}>Reset\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### useReducer for Complex State Logic\n\n```jsx\nfunction todoReducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]\n      }\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        todos: state.todos.map(todo =>\n          todo.id === action.payload\n            ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }\n            : todo\n        )\n      }\n    case 'DELETE_TODO':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        todos: state.todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== action.payload)\n      }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(todoReducer, { todos: [] })\n  \n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    dispatch({\n      type: 'ADD_TODO',\n      payload: { id: Date.now(), text, completed: false }\n    })\n  }\n  \n  return (\n    // JSX for todo app\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization Patterns\n\n### useMemo and useCallback Strategic Usage\n\n```jsx\nfunction ExpensiveComponent({ items, onItemClick }) {\n  // Memoize expensive calculations\n  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.value, 0)\n  }, [items])\n  \n  // Memoize callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders\n  const handleClick = useCallback((id) => {\n    onItemClick(id)\n  }, [onItemClick])\n  \n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>Total: {expensiveValue}\u003C/p>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        \u003CItem \n          key={item.id} \n          item={item} \n          onClick={handleClick}\n        />\n      ))}\n    \u003C/div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### React.memo with Custom Comparison\n\n```jsx\nconst ListItem = React.memo(function ListItem({ item, onEdit }) {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Ch3>{item.title}\u003C/h3>\n      \u003Cp>{item.description}\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => onEdit(item.id)}>Edit\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  )\n}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n  // Custom comparison logic\n  return prevProps.item.id === nextProps.item.id &&\n         prevProps.item.title === nextProps.item.title &&\n         prevProps.item.description === nextProps.item.description\n})\n```\n\n## Form Handling with React Hook Form\n\n```jsx\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'\nimport { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod'\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nconst schema = z.object({\n  email: z.string().email(),\n  password: z.string().min(8),\n  confirmPassword: z.string()\n}).refine(data => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {\n  message: \"Passwords don't match\",\n  path: [\"confirmPassword\"]\n})\n\nfunction SignupForm() {\n  const {\n    register,\n    handleSubmit,\n    formState: { errors, isSubmitting }\n  } = useForm({\n    resolver: zodResolver(schema)\n  })\n  \n  const onSubmit = async (data) => {\n    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))\n    console.log(data)\n  }\n  \n  return (\n    \u003Cform onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n      \u003Cinput\n        {...register('email')}\n        type=\"email\"\n        placeholder=\"Email\"\n      />\n      {errors.email && \u003Cspan>{errors.email.message}\u003C/span>}\n      \n      \u003Cinput\n        {...register('password')}\n        type=\"password\"\n        placeholder=\"Password\"\n      />\n      {errors.password && \u003Cspan>{errors.password.message}\u003C/span>}\n      \n      \u003Cbutton type=\"submit\" disabled={isSubmitting}>\n        {isSubmitting ? 'Creating Account...' : 'Sign Up'}\n      \u003C/button>\n    \u003C/form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Modern React Applications\n\n### Testing Custom Hooks\n\n```jsx\nimport { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport { useCounter } from './useCounter'\n\ntest('should increment counter', () => {\n  const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter())\n  \n  act(() => {\n    result.current.increment()\n  })\n  \n  expect(result.current.count).toBe(1)\n})\n```\n\n### Testing Components with Suspense\n\n```jsx\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport AsyncComponent from './AsyncComponent'\n\ntest('shows loading state then content', async () => {\n  render(\n    \u003CSuspense fallback={\u003Cdiv>Loading...\u003C/div>}>\n      \u003CAsyncComponent />\n    \u003C/Suspense>\n  )\n  \n  expect(screen.getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  \n  await waitFor(() => {\n    expect(screen.getByText('Content loaded')).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe React ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, with patterns that emphasize performance, developer experience, and maintainability. Server Components are reshaping how we think about data fetching and rendering, while concurrent features enable better user experiences through progressive loading.\n\nKey takeaways for 2024:\n\n1. **Embrace Server Components** for better performance and simpler data fetching\n2. **Use Suspense strategically** to improve perceived performance\n3. **Choose state management tools** based on complexity needs\n4. **Optimize performance** with memoization and careful re-render management\n5. **Invest in testing** patterns that work with modern React features\n\nAs React continues to evolve, staying current with these patterns will help you build applications that are performant, maintainable, and provide excellent user experiences.","src/content/blog/modern-react-patterns.md","8ea9507fdff72da8",{"html":562,"metadata":563},"\u003Ch1 id=\"modern-react-patterns-for-2024\">Modern React Patterns for 2024\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>React continues to evolve rapidly, and with it, the patterns and best practices that define how we build modern applications.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore practical strategies for optimizing web application performance across all key metrics.\n\n## Understanding Core Web Vitals\n\nCore Web Vitals are the foundation of modern web performance measurement. These user-centric metrics focus on what actually matters to your users.\n\n### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n**Target: ≤ 2.5 seconds**\n\nLCP measures loading performance by tracking when the largest content element becomes visible.\n\n**Optimization strategies:**\n- Optimize images with modern formats (WebP, AVIF)\n- Implement proper preloading for critical resources\n- Use CDN for faster content delivery\n- Minimize server response times\n\n### First Input Delay (FID)\n**Target: ≤ 100 milliseconds**\n\nFID measures interactivity by tracking the delay between user interaction and browser response.\n\n**Optimization strategies:**\n- Minimize JavaScript execution time\n- Use code splitting to reduce main thread blocking\n- Implement service workers for better resource management\n- Defer non-critical JavaScript\n\n### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n**Target: ≤ 0.1**\n\nCLS measures visual stability by tracking unexpected layout shifts.\n\n**Optimization strategies:**\n- Always include dimensions for images and videos\n- Reserve space for dynamically loaded content\n- Use CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties\n- Ensure fonts load predictably\n\n## Image Optimization Strategies\n\nImages often account for the majority of page weight. Optimizing them can dramatically improve performance.\n\n### Modern Image Formats\n\n```html\n\u003Cpicture>\n  \u003Csource srcset=\"image.avif\" type=\"image/avif\">\n  \u003Csource srcset=\"image.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Description\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\u003C/picture>\n```\n\n### Responsive Images\n\n```html\n\u003Cimg \n  srcset=\"\n    image-320w.jpg 320w,\n    image-640w.jpg 640w,\n    image-1280w.jpg 1280w\n  \"\n  sizes=\"\n    (max-width: 320px) 280px,\n    (max-width: 640px) 600px,\n    1200px\n  \"\n  src=\"image-640w.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Description\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n>\n```\n\n### Lazy Loading Implementation\n\n```javascript\n// Intersection Observer for lazy loading\nconst imageObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => {\n  entries.forEach(entry => {\n    if (entry.isIntersecting) {\n      const img = entry.target\n      img.src = img.dataset.src\n      img.classList.remove('lazy')\n      observer.unobserve(img)\n    }\n  })\n})\n\ndocument.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]').forEach(img => {\n  imageObserver.observe(img)\n})\n```\n\n## JavaScript Optimization\n\nJavaScript performance directly impacts user experience. Here are key strategies for optimization.\n\n### Code Splitting\n\n```javascript\n// Dynamic imports for code splitting\nconst LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'))\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003CSuspense fallback={\u003Cdiv>Loading...\u003C/div>}>\n      \u003CLazyComponent />\n    \u003C/Suspense>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Bundle Analysis\n\n```bash\n# Analyze your bundle size\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer\n\n# Add to package.json scripts\n\"analyze\": \"npm run build && npx webpack-bundle-analyzer build/static/js/*.js\"\n```\n\n### Tree Shaking\n\n```javascript\n// Import only what you need\nimport { debounce } from 'lodash/debounce'  // Good\nimport _ from 'lodash'  // Bad - imports entire library\n```\n\n## CSS Performance\n\nCSS can block rendering and impact performance. Optimize it properly.\n\n### Critical CSS\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- Inline critical CSS -->\n\u003Cstyle>\n  /* Critical above-the-fold styles */\n  .header { /* styles */ }\n  .hero { /* styles */ }\n\u003C/style>\n\n\u003C!-- Load non-critical CSS asynchronously -->\n\u003Clink rel=\"preload\" href=\"styles.css\" as=\"style\" onload=\"this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'\">\n```\n\n### CSS Containment\n\n```css\n.component {\n  contain: layout style paint;\n}\n\n.list-item {\n  contain: layout;\n}\n```\n\n## Resource Loading Optimization\n\n### Preloading Critical Resources\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- Preload critical fonts -->\n\u003Clink rel=\"preload\" href=\"font.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n\n\u003C!-- Preload critical images -->\n\u003Clink rel=\"preload\" href=\"hero-image.jpg\" as=\"image\">\n\n\u003C!-- Prefetch likely next page resources -->\n\u003Clink rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"/next-page.html\">\n```\n\n### Service Worker for Caching\n\n```javascript\n// sw.js\nconst CACHE_NAME = 'app-cache-v1'\nconst STATIC_ASSETS = [\n  '/',\n  '/styles.css',\n  '/app.js',\n  '/offline.html'\n]\n\nself.addEventListener('install', event => {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)\n      .then(cache => cache.addAll(STATIC_ASSETS))\n  )\n})\n\nself.addEventListener('fetch', event => {\n  event.respondWith(\n    caches.match(event.request)\n      .then(response => {\n        return response || fetch(event.request)\n      })\n      .catch(() => caches.match('/offline.html'))\n  )\n})\n```\n\n## Database and API Optimization\n\nBackend performance is crucial for overall user experience.\n\n### Database Query Optimization\n\n```sql\n-- Add indexes for frequently queried columns\nCREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);\n\n-- Use specific columns instead of SELECT *\nSELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE active = true;\n\n-- Implement pagination\nSELECT * FROM posts \nORDER BY created_at DESC \nLIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;\n```\n\n### API Response Optimization\n\n```javascript\n// Implement response compression\napp.use(compression())\n\n// Add caching headers\napp.get('/api/posts', (req, res) => {\n  res.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=300') // 5 minutes\n  res.json(posts)\n})\n\n// Use GraphQL for efficient data fetching\nconst typeDefs = `\n  type Query {\n    posts(limit: Int, offset: Int): [Post]\n  }\n`\n```\n\n## Monitoring and Measurement\n\n### Performance Monitoring\n\n```javascript\n// Core Web Vitals monitoring\nfunction sendToAnalytics(metric) {\n  // Send to your analytics service\n  gtag('event', metric.name, {\n    event_category: 'Web Vitals',\n    value: Math.round(metric.value),\n    custom_map: {\n      metric_id: metric.id,\n      metric_value: metric.value,\n      metric_delta: metric.delta\n    }\n  })\n}\n\n// Measure FCP\ngetCLS(sendToAnalytics)\ngetFID(sendToAnalytics)\ngetLCP(sendToAnalytics)\n```\n\n### Performance Budget\n\n```javascript\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  performance: {\n    maxAssetSize: 250000,\n    maxEntrypointSize: 250000,\n    hints: 'error'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Performance\n\n### Lighthouse CI\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/lighthouse.yml\nname: Lighthouse CI\non: [push]\njobs:\n  lighthouse:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Run Lighthouse CI\n        uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v7\n        with:\n          configPath: '.lighthouserc.json'\n```\n\n### Load Testing\n\n```javascript\n// Using k6 for load testing\nimport http from 'k6/http'\nimport { check } from 'k6'\n\nexport let options = {\n  stages: [\n    { duration: '30s', target: 20 },\n    { duration: '1m', target: 20 },\n    { duration: '30s', target: 0 }\n  ]\n}\n\nexport default function() {\n  let response = http.get('https://your-site.com')\n  check(response, {\n    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,\n    'response time \u003C 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration \u003C 500\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Checklist\n\n### Before Launch\n- [ ] Optimize images (format, size, lazy loading)\n- [ ] Minimize and compress CSS/JS\n- [ ] Implement proper caching headers\n- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets\n- [ ] Add performance monitoring\n- [ ] Test on various devices and networks\n\n### Ongoing Monitoring\n- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals regularly\n- [ ] Set up performance alerts\n- [ ] Regular performance audits\n- [ ] User experience monitoring\n- [ ] Competitive benchmarking\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWeb performance optimization is an ongoing process that requires attention to detail and continuous monitoring. By focusing on Core Web Vitals, optimizing critical resources, and implementing proper measurement strategies, you can create web applications that not only perform well but also provide exceptional user experiences.\n\nRemember that performance is not just a technical metric—it directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, and business success. Invest in performance optimization early and make it a core part of your development process.\n\nThe strategies outlined in this guide provide a solid foundation for building fast, responsive web applications.

The backend returned meta data in its response. Nothing too out of the norm there, I just hadn't dealt with that using Restangular yet.\n\nTo put things into context, here is a sample response from the server:\n\n```javascript\n// Sample data from RESTful server\n{\n  data: [\n    { name: 'John' },\n    { name: 'Doe' }\n  ],\n  meta: {\n    records: 2\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Extracting `.data` object from backend response\n\nUsually I setup an interceptor to extract the `.data` object from an APIs response. I like doing that so I don't have to repeat myself too much throughout the rest of my code.\n\n```javascript\nangular\n  .module('app')\n  .config(['RestangularProvider', function(RestangularProvider) {\n    // Always extracts `data` from response\n    RestangularProvider.setResponseExtractor(function extractResponse(serverResponse, operation) {\n      return serverResponse.data;\n    });\n  }]);\n\n```\n\nThe code above just makes sure Restangular promises receive the unwrapped `.data` object.

My 5-minute fix was to attach the `.meta` object to `.data` (it does feel ugly I am not going to lie):\n\n```javascript\nangular\n  .module('app')\n  .config(['RestangularProvider', function(RestangularProvider) {\n    // Always extracts `data` from response\n    RestangularProvider.setResponseExtractor(function extractResponse(serverResponse, operation) {\n    \n      // Response from server\n      var response = serverResponse.data;\n      \n      // Attaches meta object to the response object\n      if ('meta' in serverResponse) {\n        response.meta = serverResponse.meta;\n      }\n      \n      return response;\n    });\n  }]);\n\n```\n\nSimple right?\n\nThis solution didn't seem right to me at first. \"What if `serverResponse.data` is an array\" I thought to myself. This might break things right?  Nope, no breaking things. It turns out arrays in javascript were objects before they became arrays. So you can add properties to your arrays just fine.\n\nPS: I have only tested this solution in Chrome.

That's why I'm excited to put all the information you need in a simple-to-follow article. Please note that this article assumes you're running an unix operating system.\n\n\nHere's an overview of the steps we're covering:\n\n1. Create a personal access token on GitHub\n1. Add an npm registry resolver to your local environment\n1. Add a file to the repository that will be consuming the private package\n1. Start consuming your packages\n\nBefore we can start consuming private packages, the registry needs to know who you are each time you try to access it. That's why we'll start by creating a personal access token on GitHub. Your system will use it each time it needs to access the GitHub Packages Registry to install libraries.\n\n## Create a personal access token on GitHub\n\nStart by creating a [personal token on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new):\n\n1. For the `Note` field, put down \"GitHub Packages\" as the description, so we'll know what we used this token for in the future\n1. Under `Select scopes`, select the `repo` option: _(checking the `repo` scope, should automatically check all the options under it:)_\n    * `repo:status`\n    * `repo_deployment`\n    * `public_repo`\n    * `repo:invite`\n    * `security_events`\n    * `read:packages`\n\n1. Hit the \"Generate Token\" button\n1. Copy the newly generated token onto your clipboard, as we're going to use it shortly\n\n\n\n## Add an npm registry resolver to your local environment\n\nWe're going to authenticate you into the GitHub Packages Registry by using your GitHub username and the Personal Access Token you just created as the password. To do so, pull up your Terminal and follow these steps:\n\n* Run `npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com` and enter these options:\n  * **Username**: Enter your GitHub username\n  * **Password**: Paste the Personal Access Token you previously created\n  * **Email**: Enter an email address associated with your GitHub account\n\nNow npm will know how to forward your authentication credentials to the GitHub Packages Registry every time we try to access it. That way GitHub Packages will know who you are and what packages you have access to.\n\n\n## Configure package consumption\n\nLet's create a new file at the root of your project called `.npmrc`. This file will instruct npm (or yarn) to pull packages directly from the GitHub Packages Registry. Below is an example of what your file should look like:\n\n```shell\n# File location: `~/some-directory/your-project/.npmrc`\n# Registry for the @my-org scope\n@my-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/\n```\n\nNow any libraries you add via `npm` or `yarn` that use the `@my-org` scope will be installed directly from the GitHub Packages Registry.\n\n### A little background on package scopes\n\nThe GitHub Packages Registry requires library authors to follow a few conventions when publishing packages. Understanding those conventions will add some color to how we're configuring your development environment.\n\nWhen publishing a package to the GitHub Packages Registry, package names must live [under a package scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scope). If you're interested in examples of scoped JavaScript packages, you need to look no further than Angular projects. If you look at [any projects that use Angular](https://github.com/sergiocruz/ng-karaoke/blob/master/package.json#L17), you'll notice that the names of the dependencies that Angular brings in have a scope (aka namespace, or a vendor prefix) of `@angular`, such as `@angular/core`, or `@angular/router`.\n\nThe scope that library authors must use can be either their GitHub usernames, or their GitHub organization's name, such as `@sergiocruz/library-name`, or `@my-org/library-name`.\n\n\n### Global npm configuration instead of project-level configuration\n\nIt's my personal preference to configure package consumption by project, thereby adding an `.npmrc` file to each of my projects that will consume private libraries from the GitHub Packages Registry.\n\nI prefer project-level configuration over a global npm configuration for the same reasons why I prefer to use scoped variables instead of global variables when writing JavaScript. Some folks coined this concept as the [Strictness Principle: Restrict the scope of what you do. Increase the scope as the need arises](https://medium.com/@fagnerbrack/the-strictness-principle-9997e483cafb). I feel similarly about configuration, it's easier to spot mistakes when they're scoped to a single project. It is possible, however, to configure npm globally to consume scoped packages from the GitHub Packages Registry, if that's what you prefer to do.\n\nYou should already have an npm configuration file under your user's home directory, namely `~/.npmrc`. Add the same lines mentioned above for the per-project configuration:\n\n```shell\n# File location: ~/.npmrc\n# Registry for the @my-org scope\n@my-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/\n```\n\nNow every time you install any packages under the `@my-org` scope anywhere on your machine, npm will know to fetch those packages from the GitHub Packages Registry.\n\n\n## Start consuming your packages\n\nAfter configuring your work environment, you'll be able to follow the same steps you usually do to install any packages.\n\nPull up your terminal and run:\n\n```shell\nnpm install @my-org/package-name --save\n```\n\nIf you prefer to use `yarn`, all the previous steps we followed should work seamlessly for it.\n\n```shell\nyarn add @my-org/package-name\n```\n\nIf you'd like a deeper dive into GitHub Packages, I would suggest browsing through their documentation to learn more about [how to configure npm for use with GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages), among other use cases.\n\nI hope this a helpful resource as you get a good handle on how to consume private npm libraries using GitHub Packages.

On this article I will be covering a more realistic scenario:\n\nLet's suppose you wrote a \u003Ca href=\"https://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/controllers\" target=\"_blank\">SailsJS Controller\u003C/a> and a SailsJS Service. You got them to work together, and now you want to mock the service while testing your controller.\n\nThe problem is that SailsJS *magically* injects Services -- and Models, and everything else -- into the Controller, making it difficult to simply call `HelloController.index()` without *lifting SailsJS*. We need the dependencies to be in place (otherwise we will get a bunch of ugly *undefined is not a function* kind of errors.\n\nFortunately, *lifting SailsJS* in code is almost as easy as running `sails lift` on your command line, and that is exactly what we are going to do in order run our tests.\n\n## So... how do I mock services in my controllers?\n\n*I'm glad you asked!* First things first, pretend we already have a controller and a service in place: The controller is called `TestingServicesController` and the service is called `MyFirstService`.\n\n**Step 1:**\nStart by instantiating SailsJS in your test file:\n\n```javascript\nvar Sails = require('sails'),\n    sinon = require('sinon'),\n    assert = require('assert');\n```\n\n**Step 2:**\nLift SailsJS before executing each test and *lower* it after the test is executed:\n```javascript\n\nvar app,\n\ttestingServicesController;\n\n// Gets run before each test\nbefore(function beforeControllerTest(done) {\n\n  // Lift Sails and start the server\n  Sails.lift({\n\n    log: {\n      level: 'error'\n    },\n\n  }, function(err, sails) {\n  \n  \t// Instantiates new sails application\n    app = sails;\n    \n    // Instantiates controller\n    testingServicesController = app.controllers.testingservices;\n    \n    // Lets testing framework know async call is done\n    done(err, sails);\n  });\n});\n\n// Gets run after each test\nafter(function afterControllerTest(done){\n\n  // Destroys application\n  app.lower(done);\n  \n});\n```\n\n**Step 3:**\nMock service and test controller\n\n```javascript\nit('should have called mocked service', function() {\n\n  // Mocking our service\n  sinon.stub(app.services.myfirstservice, 'sayHello', function() {\n    return 'Hello I am the mocked Service';\n  });\n\n  // JSON object spy\n  var send = sinon.spy();\n\n  // Executes controller action\n  testingServicesController.index(null, {\n    'send': send\n  });\n\n  // Makes sure the mocked service was called\n  // instead of the real one\n  assert(send.called);\n  assert(send.calledWith('Our service has a message for you: Hello I am the mocked Service'));\n\n  // Restores our mock to the original service\n  app.services.myfirstservice.sayHello.restore();\n  // Notice that the above action this is very important\n  // because if the original action does not get restored,\n  // then this mock will be used in other tests\n  \n});\n```\n\n## Putting the pieces of the puzzle together\n\nBelow is what my code looks like when we put all three steps together:\n\n```javascript\nvar Sails = require('sails'),\n    sinon = require('sinon'),\n    assert = require('assert');\n\ndescribe('The TestingServices Controller', function() {\n\n  // app and testingServicesController \n  var app,\n      testingServicesController;\n\n  // Global before hook\n  before(function beforeControllerTest(done) {\n\n    // Lift Sails and start the server\n    Sails.lift({\n\n      log: {\n        level: 'error'\n      },\n\n    }, function(err, sails) {\n      app = sails;\n\n      // TestingServices controller\n      testingServicesController = app.controllers.testingservices;\n\n      done(err, sails);\n    });\n  });\n\n  after(function afterControllerTest(done){\n    app.lower(done);\n  });\n\n  describe('when we invoke the index action', function() {\n\n    before(function() {\n      // Mocking our service\n      sinon.stub(app.services.myfirstservice, 'sayHello', function() {\n        return 'Hello I am the mocked Service';\n      });\n    });\n\n    after(function() {\n      // Restores our mock to the original service\n      app.services.myfirstservice.sayHello.restore();\n    });\n\n    it('should have called mocked service', function() {\n\n      // JSON object spy\n      var send = sinon.spy();\n\n      // Executes controller action\n      testingServicesController.index(null, {\n        'send': send\n      });\n\n      // Makes sure the mocked service was called\n      // instead of the real one\n      assert(send.called);\n      assert(send.calledWith('Our service has a message for you: Hello I am the mocked Service'));\n    });\n\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n### Demo and code samples\nYou know you can always count on me when it comes to post my working code to GitHub!

When I wrote this post getting a testing environment setup was not easy at all. So I decided to write this article describing some basic steps.\n\n## With Create React App\n\nIf you used [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to generate your project, then your project is pre-configured to generate [Code Coverage Reports](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#coverage-reporting). To generate a report, run this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm test -- --coverage\n```\n\nNotice a new directory called `/coverage` will be created at the root of your project.\n\n## Configuring Jest to run React Tests\n\n**Step 1:**  Get your new project setup (`npm init`)\n\n**Step 2:** Bring in npm dependencies:\n\n- `npm install --save-dev jest`\n- `npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env`\n\n**Step3:** Add the following lines to your `package.json` file:\n\n```javascript\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"test\": \"jest\",\n},\n\"jest\": {\n  \"collectCoverageFrom\": [\n    \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\",\n    \"!src/**/*.d.ts\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Write your component:\n\n```jsx\n// File location: app/components/App.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Ch1>Hello World\u003C/h1>\n    \u003C/div>\n  )\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  \u003CApp />,\n  document.getElementById('app')\n);\n\n```\n\n**Step 5:** Create a `__tests__` directory on your project's root and write your first test.\n\n_**Protip:** Jest's conventions suggest using a directory called `__tests__` on your project's root. Good news is you can change that, [check out the docs](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html#config-testdirectoryname-string)._\n\n```javascript\n// File location: __tests__/app/App-test.js\njest.dontMock('../../app/components/App');\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactTestUtils from 'react-dom/test-utils';\nimport App from '../../app/components/App';\n\ndescribe('App', function() {\n\n  it('renders with correct text', function() {\n\n    const app = ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(\n      \u003CApp />\n    );\n\n    const appNode = React.findDOMNode(app);\n\t\n    // Asserts that the text in the \u003Ch1> tag\n    // is equal to \"Hello World\" (like our App component)\n    expect(\n      appNode.querySelector('h1').textContent\n    ).toEqual('Hello World');\n\n  });\n\n});\n\n```\n\n**Step 6:** Run tests and you should be all done: `npm test`\n\nPS: Don't forget to checkout the `coverage` directory. It contains all your code coverage reports.\n\n### A word on conventions\n\nFor my projects, I decided to have an `app` directory where all my code lives. I then replicate the `app` directory within `__tests__` directory. That way all my files and test files have the same name, except the test file names end with a `-test` after its name. For example: the component file `app/App.js` would have its test in the following location: `__tests__/app/App-test.js`.\n\n### Code sample\nIf you're anything like me, you like seeing code samples. Feel free to check out the app I have been writing. It uses some of the conventions I've described in this post: https://github.com/sergiocruz/react-connect4","src/content/blog/2015-08-02-react-jest-unit-test.md","d2b3e67f0c1a9019",{"html":936,"metadata":937},"\u003Cp>The recommended testing framework for \u003Ca href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React\u003C/a> is \u003Ca href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest\u003C/a>.

I then replicate the \u003Ccode>app\u003C/code> directory within \u003Ccode>__tests__\u003C/code> directory. That way all my files and test files have the same name, except the test file names end with a \u003Ccode>-test\u003C/code> after its name. For example: the component file \u003Ccode>app/App.js\u003C/code> would have its test in the following location: \u003Ccode>__tests__/app/App-test.js\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"code-sample\">Code sample\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>If you’re anything like me, you like seeing code samples.
